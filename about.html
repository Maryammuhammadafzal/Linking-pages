    <h1>FAMOUS BUILDINGS</h1>
    <P>When it comes to learning about the history of a new destination, travelers should look no further than its
         iconic buildings. Of course, there are other ways to discover the local culture, which can be reflected 
         in the food, the textiles, and the dialects, but it’s the buildings that can reveal the most about a
         place. Local landmarks are—in essence— silent witnesses to past eras, kingdoms, and tastes, but they
         can also offer us clues to what the future holds (not to mention make for a great travel gram, too

    <h1 id="burjkhalifa">BURJ KHALIFA</h1>
    <p>The Burj Khalifa (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai,
         United Arab Emirates. It is the world's tallest structure. With a total height of 829.8 m 
         (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)
         of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its
         topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status</p>
     
    <h1 id="tajmahal">TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <p>The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb in India. It was built in the 17th century 
        by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its chief architect was Ustad Ahmed
        Lahauri.The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It is widely thought as one of the most
        beautiful buildings in the world. It is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.</p>

    <h1 id="minarepakistan">MINAR-E-PAKISTAN</h1>
    <p>Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مینارِ پاکستان, literally "Tower of Pakistan") is a tower located in Lahore, 
        Punjab, Pakistan.[1] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim 
        League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the
        first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused 
        by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947</p>

    <h1 id="leaningtower">LEANING TOWER</h1>
    <p>The Leaning Tower’s construction occurred in three stages over 199 years. The tilt began during the 12th 
        century due to the murky foundation. First, the ground was too soft on one side and couldn’t support the 
        entire structure’s weight.Then, the tilt became more prominent in the period before the completion of the 
        tower. It escalated, but the structure stabilized in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. More than 5
         million tourists visit the leaning tower each year</p>

    <h1 id="suleymaniyemosque">SULEYMANIYE MOSQUE</h1>
    <p>The Süleymaniye Mosque is an Ottoman imperial mosque located on the Third Hill of Istanbul, Turkey.
         The mosque was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan.
          An inscription specifies the foundation date as 1550 and the inauguration date as 1557.</p>
